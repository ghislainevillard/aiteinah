They exploded in a mass of pixels and TARTAR ooze when they die. So they're basically corpse puppets being controlled by TARTAR, with some robotic parts stuffed inside to make them less. flimsy. So, Inklings and Octolings do indeed have corpses. We just never see any of them because they get splatted upon death due to the nature. I just remembered something that I wanted to do once Triassic Triumph hit, and that was to use Disco Dance Floor to find Overshoot animations ~~since I'm not even remotely lucky to have Moon Base Z and I'm too frugal with my sparks to craft it~~. Unfortunately, I can't get the abilities of Gravestone Zombies due to Fusion. but oh well. So. the search is on!

I've been playing Murky and he is far better than people give him credit for. Unfortunately everyone is using him in the same method just trying to backdoor and siege. This is not where Murky shines. This game is about team fights and having value within them. I've never written a guide before, and I'm not a pro at HotS, but I'll do my best to outline why I consistently have the highest player damage and siege damage output in my matches.
