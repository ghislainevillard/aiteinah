Normally, upon waking up, it prompts for my password but sometime this week, it stopped doing that. I checked to make sure that the settings had not change and as far as I can tell, they haven't. They all still show that a password is required upon waking up from sleep but that's not happening anymore, which made me suspect that my computer wasn't going to sleep properly. The next thing I'm tech savvy and this one has stumped me for a while now. Just this morning, my speakers were working with no issue. I was attempting to play with my Vive and was getting some weird issues with the HMD freezing, so I decided to reboot. After the PC came back up, I noticed that I wasn't getting any sound on a video I was trying to watch in Steam. So I tried Spotify. No luck there, either. I changed the playback device to my headphones and I was getting sound, no problem. I changed I used to have a Creative X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro and had no issues. Once I purchased a much higher quality headset however, I needed a sound card that could handle the higher impedance and thus purchased a SoundBlaster Z. and hear's where my journey through Voldemort's "Rancid Valley" started. Every-other time I would turn on my PC it was a dice toss "do I have audio this time?" to which the reply was usually "NOPE!" every-other power cycle. The issue was that although I had installed. I've been having some recent trouble with SF5. I'm hoping someone can help me.

When my sound dies skype tells me that it can't locate a sound card.?

So Hi guys, I have problems with my Direct X. I've research a lot on the web for solution and still didn't find a solution for my problem, also tried many solution from other like-looking Problems without any success.

I just bought a Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro Plus and was very excited to try it, but when I plugged it in, it was never detected by my PC. I plugged it into an iPad, a laptop, and a Google Pixel, and they all worked flawlessly. I've tried using both cables provided in the box, in every 3.5mm jack on my case, including off-colour ones. I've reinstalled all audio drivers I can think of. I've disconnected my soundcard and tried using my motherboards onboard sound, but it didn't work, and plugged. Sometimes when I am gaming for a couple of hours my pc just crashes, it has only happened about 6 times while playing gta IV and shadows of mordor. At first I thought that maybe my new GPU was running too hot, but according to heaven benchmark it only goes to 75c max after benchmarking for 5 times and everything maxed out even after said crashes Sorry if my English is not good enough yet, its not my native language My specs Core i5 4440 with stock cooler, no OC Evga gtx 970 ftw edition Corsair.

Hi there, i'm looking for a new headset for gaming (gameplay and chat), but also for music and movies. Actual i use a Creative Fatality wired headset with two 3,5mm clinch. But my iMac has only one digital/combined input and i don't like wired headset, because i dont want to put it off when i go to kitchen or sit in the armchair behind my desk to watch a movie.
