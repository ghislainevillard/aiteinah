User Guide for 4 axis TB6560 driver board Product Features: • Toshiba TB6560AHQ chip - High power, maximum 3.5A drive current chipset ! • 1-1/16 microstep setting - Higher accuracy and smoother operation than standard Just recent bought a cheap tb6550 for 50 bucks on amazon. I was able to wire it and get it going with mach 3. My x axis motor started stuttering so i figured i would replace the y plug with the x plug and see if there was any difference between the two. After i did that the chip on the bottom of the circuit fried. The set up i have is a sherling 5000 mill. The person that sold it to me has the computer that sherline provides for the cnc mill. I was willing to pay for the computer today. I plugg. Using a Single-Axis TB6560 Stepper Driver With GRBL/RAMPS: I developed an obsession with laser engravers and CNC routers and 3d printers. I first bought a Printrbot that worked perfectly The CNC TB6560 4 Axis Stepper Motor Driver Board comes with DB25 parallel cables and wire connectors. It is suitable for processing various pattern modules, carving portrait, scenery, handwriting and sealing. So, I recently found an XY stage on Ebay. I've now started to play with it and had a choice of stepper drivers to use. I thought you guys might be interested in the results. The paths aren't quite the same for both videos, but both drivers are tuned as well as I can make them using Stepconf and LinuxCNC. Chinese 4-Axis TB6560AHQ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RufHddJmeg) Gecko G540 (4-Axis) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwPgvKXl6Xs) Now, there is a marked price difference. 
TB6560 Microstepping Bipolar Chopper Stepper Motor Driver: In this article I will describe how I built stepper motor drivers for about USD a piece. Included will be a complete schematic, a sample board layout, and links to YouTube videos of the driver running under clock and computer control. Note: this board is neither reprappable nor open source, so it's a bit questionable whether it belongs into this Wiki. Bogdan stuffed it into the wiki since he's using one or two, and he suggests folk may want to check I'm trying to build a CNC router after finishing my 3d printer, but I'm not completely understanding the electronics. So far on my list is stepper motors for the 3 axis, 3 tb6560 drivers and an arduino to control it all (planning on using grbl firmware) Is this all i'd need to get it up and running? I used RAMPS 1.4 for my 3d printer, but am not sure if some kind of similar shield for the arduino would be needed. I read a bit about breakout boards, but I'm not completely sure why I shouldn't.

So Im running a couple of single axis TB6560 drivers through a MACH3 breakout board. I connect the enable pin to the TB6560 en+. The drive cuts power to the stepper motors. So when nothing is connected to the en+ pin, the drive works fine. When I connect it to drives shut off. I tried to invert the output of the pin on the MACH3 breakout board but it still keeps the board from powering the stepper motors. It seems that when the the en+ pin recieves electricity, it shuts down the Drive Nema 24 Stepper Motor with only slightly larger dimensions (60 x 60 mm) than Nema 23 Stepper Motor, but have more powerful than it.
